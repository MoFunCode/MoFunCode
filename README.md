  ## 🚀 What I'm Building

  Right now I'm heads down on **NiyyahMatch** - a Muslim matchmaking app that's intentionally different.

  The idea? You can only have **one active match at a time**. No endless swiping. No paradox of choice. Just focused,
  meaningful connections.

  **The Stack:** Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • React • JWT
  **The Goal:** Launch to 50-100 real users in Q1 2026

  I'm in the middle of building out authentication and the match lock system. It's my first full production app, and
  honestly, I'm learning a ton as I go.

  ## 🎯 Where I'm At

  Just wrapped up my apprenticeship at **Apple** where I worked on Radar - the internal bug tracking system thousands of
   Apple engineers use daily. Got to ship real features and see how production systems work at scale.

  **Now I'm:**
  - Building NiyyahMatch from scratch (backend → deployment)
  - Sharpening my Spring Boot and API design skills
  - Looking for my next role as an Associate SWE

  I love backend work - there's something satisfying about building the infrastructure that makes everything else
  possible. Databases, APIs, authentication, the whole stack.

  <details>
  <summary><b>📖 A bit about my path here (if you're curious)</b></summary>

  <br>

  I grew up in a refugee camp in Sudan for thirteen years. No electricity, no internet. When I got to America, I didn't
  speak English and had never used a computer.

  **The journey was messy but it worked:**

  Started in manufacturing → saw an automation script register users automatically → thought "wait, I want to do THAT" →
   bootcamp in Virginia → Year Up (400+ hours grinding Java and Spring Boot) → apprenticeship at Apple.

  Now I'm building NiyyahMatch and looking for what's next.

  **What keeps me going:**

  I was the only person from my village who made it out. That weight never left me. I know what it's like to be on the
  outside looking in - whether from language, background, or just not fitting the traditional tech mold.

  So I build things with that in mind. Tech should work for everyone, not just people who already look like they belong.
